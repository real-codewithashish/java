What is Java technology and why do I need it?
Java is a programming language and computing platform first released by Sun Microsystems in 1995. It has evolved from humble beginnings to power a large share of today’s digital world, by providing the reliable platform upon which many services and applications are built. New, innovative products and digital services designed for the future continue to rely on Java, as well.

While most modern Java applications combine the Java runtime and application together, there are still many applications and even some websites that will not function unless you have a desktop Java installed. Java.com, this website, is intended for consumers who may still require Java for their desktop applications – specifically applications targeting Java 8. Developers as well as users that would like to learn Java programming should visit the dev.java website instead and business users should visit oracle.com/java for more information.

Is Java free to download?
Yes, Java is free to download for personal use.
Java is also free for development: developers can find all the development kits and other useful tools at https://www.oracle.com/javadownload/.

Why should I upgrade to the latest Java patch each quarter when prompted?
The latest Java patches contain important enhancements to improve performance, stability and security of the Java applications that run on your machine. Installing these updates will ensure that your Java applications continue to run with the most up-to-date version.

MORE TECHNICAL INFORMATION


What will I get when I download Java software from java.com?
The Java Runtime Environment (JRE) version 8 is what you get when you download Java software from java.com.

The JRE consists of the Java Virtual Machine (JVM), Java platform core classes, and supporting Java platform libraries. The JRE is the runtime portion of Java software, which is all you need to run Java WebStart applications from a supported web browser. It doesn’t come with development tools, though – these tools are part of the Java Development Kit (JDK).


What is Java Plug-in software?
The Java Plug-in software is a component of the Java Runtime Environment (JRE). The JRE allows some applications written in the Java programming language to launch via some browsers. The Java Plug-in software is not a standalone program and cannot be installed separately.


I have heard the terms Java Virtual Machine and JVM. Is this Java software?
The Java Virtual Machine is only one part of Java software that is involved in running an application. The Java Virtual Machine is built right into your Java software download, part of the JRE and helps run Java applications.
